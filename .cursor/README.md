## Getting Started

### 1. PRISM + Cursor Framework Installation
```bash
# Copy both PRISM and Cursor frameworks to your project
cp -r /path/to/framework/.cursor /your/project/root/
cp -r /path/to/framework/.prism /your/project/root/
cp /path/to/framework/PRISM.md /your/project/root/
cp /path/to/framework/prism-context.sh /your/project/root/
chmod +x /your/project/root/prism-context.sh

# Or use the automated setup script
./setup-new-project.sh /your/project/root/

# Verify installation
ls -la .cursor/rules/
ls -la .prism/
./prism-context.sh status
```

### 2. PRISM + Cursor Configuration
1. **Initialize PRISM**: Run `./prism-context.sh init` to set up context system
2. **Open in Cursor**: Open your project in Cursor IDE
3. **Verify Rules**: Navigate to `Cursor Settings > Rules` and verify project rules are active
4. **Check Integration**: Verify PRISM integration with `./prism-context.sh status`
5. **Time Sync**: Confirm time synchronization is working (check `.prism/.time_sync`)
6. **Test Generation**: Test with a simple code generation task

### 3. PRISM Workflow Integration
Follow the **PRISM-enhanced qnew-qplan-qcode-qcheck-qgit** workflow:

- **qnew**: WebSearch time sync, load PRISM context, check session continuity
- **qplan**: Review architecture/patterns from `.prism/context/`, update session plan
- **qcode**: Log decisions with `prism-context.sh add`, update patterns, track session
- **qcheck**: Validate against PRISM context, log findings, verify architecture alignment
- **qgit**: Archive session with `prism-context.sh archive`, commit with PRISM attribution

## Progressive Enhancement Pattern

‚úÖ Edge cases and validations  
‚úÖ Meaningful error messages  
‚úÖ Graceful degradation  

### Phase 3: Security Implementation
‚úÖ Input sanitization  
‚úÖ Authentication/authorization  
‚úÖ Rate limiting  

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
‚úÖ Profile and optimize  
‚úÖ Caching strategies  
‚úÖ Database optimization  

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing
‚úÖ Unit tests (‚â•85% coverage)  
‚úÖ Integration tests  
‚úÖ Security tests  

### Phase 6: Refactoring
‚úÖ Code maintainability  
‚úÖ Documentation  
‚úÖ Pattern consistency  

## Multi-Layer Review Process

Every AI-generated code goes through:

1. **ü§ñ AI Review**: Automated scanning and pattern validation
2. **üîí Security Check**: Manual security validation (required for auth code)
3. **‚ö° Performance Audit**: Complexity analysis and benchmarking
4. **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Alignment**: System design consistency check
5. **üë§ Human Approval**: Final review by senior developer

## Emergency Protocols

### Context Corruption
**Signs**: Inconsistent patterns, quality degradation, nonsensical output
**Response**: Stop immediately ‚Üí Clear context ‚Üí Document issues ‚Üí Restart with constraints

### Security Incidents
**Level 1 (Critical)**: Stop deployments ‚Üí Isolate systems ‚Üí Notify security team
**Level 2 (Configuration)**: Fix in place ‚Üí Add monitoring ‚Üí Enhanced review
**Level 3 (Best Practices)**: Document ‚Üí Plan fix ‚Üí Update training

### Quality Degradation
**High Severity**: Immediate rollback ‚Üí Fresh generation ‚Üí Enhanced validation
**Medium Severity**: Refactor in place ‚Üí Add tests ‚Üí Mandatory review
**Low Severity**: Document ‚Üí Fix during next cycle

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature with PRISM
```
PRISM Initialization:
1. WebSearch: "current UTC time" (automatic)
2. Load context from .prism/context/architecture.md
3. Check previous decisions: ./prism-context.sh query "authentication"
4. Update session: .prism/sessions/current.md

Context: Senior developer working on Node.js e-commerce API
Architecture: RESTful API, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis cache (from .prism/context/)
Task: Implement user authentication with JWT tokens

## Customization

### PRISM + Project-Specific Rules
Create additional rules and customize PRISM context:
```
project/
  .cursor/rules/           # Global project rules
  .prism/context/          # PRISM context files
    architecture.md        # Customize for your architecture
    patterns.md           # Add your code patterns
    dependencies.md       # Track your tech stack
    decisions.md          # Log technical decisions
  backend/
    .cursor/rules/         # Backend-specific rules
  frontend/
    .cursor/rules/         # Frontend-specific rules
```

### Glob Pattern Examples
```yaml
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts"]          # JavaScript/TypeScript files
globs: ["**/api/**/*.py"]              # Python API files only  
globs: ["**/components/**/*.jsx"]      # React components only
globs: ["**/*.test.*", "**/*.spec.*"] # Test files only
```
