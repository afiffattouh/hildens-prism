# PRISM Emergency Protocols for AI-Assisted Development

## Time Synchronization Issues

### Detection Signs
**IMMEDIATE ATTENTION** required when you observe:

- **TIME DRIFT**: System time vs web time difference >5 minutes
- **SYNC FAILURES**: Unable to WebSearch "current UTC time"
- **TIMESTAMP INCONSISTENCIES**: Logs showing incorrect timestamps
- **CONTEXT DATE MISMATCHES**: `.prism/sessions/` files with wrong dates

### Time Sync Recovery Protocol

#### 1. Immediate Response
```
⚠️ TIME SYNC FAILURE DETECTED
- Stop current session
- Execute: ./prism-context.sh init (forces time resync)
- Verify: Check .prism/.time_sync for accurate web time
- Validate: Compare with system time
```

#### 2. Manual Time Sync (If WebSearch Fails)
```bash
# Emergency time sync procedure
echo "Manual time sync required" >> .prism/.time_sync
date -u >> .prism/.time_sync
echo "WebSearch failed - using system time" >> .prism/.time_sync

# Update session with warning
echo "## TIME SYNC WARNING" >> .prism/sessions/current.md
echo "WebSearch for time failed - using system time" >> .prism/sessions/current.md
```

#### 3. Context Validation After Time Sync
- **VERIFY**: All timestamps in `.prism/sessions/current.md` are accurate
- **UPDATE**: Session files with correct synchronized time
- **LOG**: Time sync recovery in `.prism/.time_sync`

## PRISM Context Corruption Response

### Detection Signs
**IMMEDIATE ATTENTION** required when you observe:

- **INCONSISTENT PATTERNS**: Generated code violates established conventions
- **REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR**: AI repeats same mistakes or suggestions
- **LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES**: Code doesn't make sense or contradicts requirements
- **QUALITY DEGRADATION**: Sudden drop in code quality or best practices
- **PATTERN VIOLATIONS**: Departure from established architectural patterns
- **NONSENSICAL OUTPUT**: AI generates irrelevant or incorrect code

### Immediate Response Protocol

#### 1. Stop Generation Immediately
```
⚠️ STOP: Context corruption detected
- Halt current generation
- Do not commit corrupted code
- Save current work state
- Document corruption symptoms
```

#### 2. PRISM Context Recovery Process
**EXECUTE** this recovery sequence:

1. **SAVE WORK**: Preserve any valid code and PRISM context
   ```bash
   # Create backup of current work
   git stash push -m "WIP: Before PRISM context reset - $(date)"
   
   # Backup PRISM context
   cp -r .prism .prism_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   ```

2. **PRISM CONTEXT RESET**: Clean and reinitialize PRISM system
   ```bash
   # Archive corrupted session
   ./prism-context.sh archive
   
   # Prune corrupted context (emergency)
   ./prism-context.sh prune 0
   
   # Reinitialize PRISM
   ./prism-context.sh init
   ```

3. **ASSESS PRISM DAMAGE**: Review context files for corruption
   - Check `.prism/context/` files for nonsensical entries
   - Verify `.prism/sessions/history/` for pattern analysis
   - Document corruption patterns in `.prism/context/decisions.md`

4. **RESTORE CLEAN CONTEXT**: Rebuild from backup if necessary
   ```bash
   # If corruption is severe, restore from backup
   rm -rf .prism
   cp -r .prism_backup_[timestamp] .prism
   ./prism-context.sh init
   ```

#### 3. PRISM Prevention Measures
**IMPLEMENT** to prevent future PRISM corruption:
- **FREQUENT ARCHIVES**: Use `./prism-context.sh archive` every 30-45 minutes
- **FOCUSED SESSIONS**: Limit each session to single feature/component (tracked in `.prism/sessions/current.md`)
- **CONTEXT VALIDATION**: Regularly check `.prism/context/` files for accuracy
- **BACKUP AUTOMATION**: Create daily backups of `.prism/` directory

## Quality Degradation Response

### Quality Degradation Indicators

**MONITOR** for these warning signs:

#### Code Quality Issues
- **COMPLEXITY INCREASE**: Cyclomatic complexity >10
- **PATTERN VIOLATIONS**: Departure from established patterns
- **POOR NAMING**: Generic or unclear variable/function names
- **MISSING ERROR HANDLING**: Lack of proper error management
- **SECURITY GAPS**: Missing input validation or security measures

#### Performance Issues
- **INEFFICIENT ALGORITHMS**: O(n²) when O(n) solutions exist
- **RESOURCE LEAKS**: Memory or connection leaks
- **BLOCKING OPERATIONS**: Synchronous operations that should be async
- **UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY**: Over-engineered simple solutions

#### Architecture Issues
- **TIGHT COUPLING**: Components too dependent on each other
- **POOR SEPARATION**: Mixed concerns in single components
- **INCONSISTENT INTERFACES**: Varying API patterns
- **DEPENDENCY VIOLATIONS**: Circular or inappropriate dependencies

### Quality Recovery Protocol

#### 1. Immediate Assessment
```markdown
## Quality Degradation Assessment
- [ ] Identify affected code components
- [ ] Measure quality metrics (complexity, maintainability)
- [ ] Compare against baseline quality standards
- [ ] Document specific quality issues found
- [ ] Assess impact on system architecture
```

#### 2. Rollback Decision Matrix

| Quality Issue | Severity | Action Required |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Critical security vulnerability | High | Immediate rollback |
| Performance degradation >50% | High | Immediate rollback |
| Architecture violation | Medium | Refactor in place |
| Minor pattern inconsistency | Low | Document and fix |
| Style guide violations | Low | Fix during refactoring |

#### 3. Recovery Actions

**FOR HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES**:
1. **IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK**: Revert to last known good state
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~n  # Where n is number of bad commits
   # Or restore from specific commit
   git checkout <last-good-commit-hash>
   ```

2. **PRISM CONTEXT RESET**: Reinitialize PRISM system
   ```bash
   ./prism-context.sh archive  # Save current session
   ./prism-context.sh init     # Fresh initialization
   ```

3. **ENHANCED REVIEW**: Implement additional quality gates
4. **DOCUMENTATION**: Record in `.prism/context/decisions.md` with lessons learned

**FOR MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES**:
1. **REFACTOR IN PLACE**: Fix issues without rolling back
2. **ADD TESTS**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
3. **CODE REVIEW**: Mandatory human review before merge
4. **MONITORING**: Add monitoring for similar issues

## Security Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

#### Level 2: Security Configuration Issues
- **WEAK ENCRYPTION**: Poor cryptographic choices
- **INSECURE DEFAULTS**: Unsafe default configurations  
- **MISSING VALIDATION**: Insufficient input validation
