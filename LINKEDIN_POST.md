## Version 4: Quality-Focused Approach

**Software quality isn't about perfection on day one.**

**It's about how fast you fix what matters.**

Last week, we shipped PRISM v2.4.0 with revolutionary TOON integration - 41-49% token savings validated through comprehensive testing.

Then we did something critical: **We tested everything.**

35 comprehensive tests across:
• Core CLI commands
• Configuration management
• TOON conversion
• Session handling
• Agent operations
• Skills system
• Update mechanism

**The result? We found 3 critical bugs.**

Most teams would push those fixes over months. We fixed them all and shipped v2.4.1 in 48 hours.

**🎯 What v2.4.1 delivers:**

**Complete Configuration System** - 255 lines of production-ready config management that should have shipped with v2.4.0. Now it's here.

**Rock-Solid Diagnostics** - Fixed doctor false positives so you know your installation is healthy.

**Instant Updates** - GitHub API integration eliminates 5-10 minute CDN cache delays.

**100% Test Pass Rate** - Every feature, every command, fully validated.

**The bigger lesson?**

Speed to fix > speed to ship. Zero breaking changes. Full backward compatibility. Your workflow stays intact.

**Update now:** `prism update`

🔗 **See the full changelog:** https://prism.hildens.ai

Because production-ready means "tested and fixed", not "shipped and hoped".
