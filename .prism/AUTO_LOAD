# AUTO-LOAD INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE CODE

When you see this file, IMMEDIATELY:
1. Check .prism/TIMESTAMP file for initialization time
2. Check .prism_active file for framework status
3. Load all files in .prism/context/
4. State: "PRISM Framework v2.0.4 - Context Loaded (initialized: [timestamp from file])"
5. Apply all patterns and conventions
6. Check for active session in .prism/sessions/current.md
7. ENFORCE: NO documentation files outside .prism/ structure
